I received my Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics-Physics Fundamental science from the Yingcai Honors College at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China ([UESTC](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/)) in 2025. My advisor was [Prof. Xile Zhao](https://zhaoxile.github.io/). My research focuses on the designing tensor decomposition algorithms for data reconstruction.

I am an incoming Ph.D. student majoring in AI at the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Oregon State University ([OSU](https://oregonstate.edu/)), starting in Fall 2025, under the supervision of [Prof. Xiao Fu](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~fuxia/).
